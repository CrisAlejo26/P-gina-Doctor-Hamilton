That all changed when I saw Dr. Hamilton. She was able to diagnose the root cause of my pain and provided me with a treatment plan that has significantly improved my quality of life. I am so grateful for her expertise and compassion.</p>

                        <p className='testimonials_paragraph'>Dr. Hamilton performed surgery on my knee and I couldnâ€™t be happier with the results. The entire process, from the initial consultation to the post-op follow-up, was smooth and stress-free. Dr. Hamilton is skill as a surgeon is matched only by his kindness and bedside manner. I highly recommend him to anyone in need of orthopedic care.</p>
